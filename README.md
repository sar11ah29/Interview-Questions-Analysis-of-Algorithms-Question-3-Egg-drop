Interview Questions: Analysis of Algorithms Question 3 Egg drop
Egg drop. Suppose that you have an nn-story building (with floors 1 through nn) and plenty of eggs. An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor TT or higher and does not break otherwise. Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value of  TT given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:

Version 0: 1 egg, \le T≤T tosses.

Version 1:  \sim 1 \lg n∼1lgn eggs and  \sim 1 \lg n∼1lgn tosses.

Version 2: \sim \lg T∼lgT eggs and  \sim 2 \lg T∼2lgT tosses.

Version 3: 22 eggs and  \sim 2 \sqrt n∼2 
n
​
  tosses.

Version 4: 22 eggs and  \le c \sqrt T≤c 
T
​
  tosses for some fixed constant cc.
